# FSI PACE P Modeling

This repo describes how to use formal methods and P framework to describe and validate the architecture of your distributed systems. 
It specifically focuses on distributed transaction processing systems. 
It uses P model to describe two types of transaction processing systems, first one using active-passive architecture and the second one using active-active architecture. 
It leverages P framework to explore three specific goals.

* ***Architecture Rationalization***: Reason about the architecture of the transaction processing systems 
* ***Disaster Recovery***: Simulate failover of the transaction processing systems
* ***Chaos Engineering***: Simulate various failure scenarios for the transaction processing systems
